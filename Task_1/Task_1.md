## Task \#1

### Monty has a file containing movie names and their genre. Being a comedian, he wants to watch comedy movies only but he can't figure out a way to get a complete list of comedy movies only. Help him by converting [this](https://github.com/opencodeiiita/Monty_Python_Class/blob/master/Task_1/movies.csv) **CSV** file into a **JSON** file using a python script so that he can have his watchlist ready.
